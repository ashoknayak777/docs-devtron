## Introduction <a href="https://devtron.ai/pricing"><img src="https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg" className="enterprise-badge-img" /></a>

The **Overview** page provides a summary of infrastructure costs across your Applications, Clusters, Environments, Projects, and Infra Components in Devtron. It highlights overall spend, resource-level distribution, and opportunities for optimization (Potential Savings).

At the top, you can choose your preferred currency time and time duration to set the context for your usage costs. This makes sure all costs on the **Overview** page are displayed in the correct currency and time range.

![Figure 1: Cost Visibility Overview](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/cost-visibility/cost-visibility-overview.jpg)

Cost Overview has the following sections:

1. [At a Glance](#at-a-glance)
2. [Potential Savings](#potential-savings)
3. [Track Performance](#track-performance)
4. [Actions and Insights](#actions-and-insights)

### How is the cost calculated?

* Devtron calculates and updates cost data **every hour** based on the resource usage metrics collected from **Prometheus**.  
* Prometheus gathers real-time data for **CPU**, **Memory**, **GPU**, and **Storage (PV)** from your connected clusters.  
* Devtron then processes this data every hour to display accurate and up-to-date cost insights across your infrastructure.

## At a Glance

The **At a Glance** displays **Total Cost**, **CPU Cost**, **RAM Cost**, **PV Cost**, and **GPU Cost** cards. Each card shows the  cost of its specific component, its percentage contribution to the overall spend, and a cost trend graph for the selected time period.

<SupademoEmbed id="cmg7svcus10om2nommllm1nu2" /><br />

<!-- | Card             | Description                                                                                      |
|:---------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total Cost**   | Shows the overall infrastructure cost, and the cost-trend graph for the selected period of time |
| **CPU Cost**     | Shows the cost of CPU resources, their percentage contribution to the total cost, and the cost-trend graph for the selected period of time |
| **RAM Cost**     | Shows the cost of memory resources, their percentage contribution to the total cost, and the cost-trend graph for the selected period of time |
| **PV Cost**      | Shows the cost of persistent volume (storage), its percentage contribution to the total cost, and the cost-trend graph for the selected period of time |
| **GPU Cost**     | Shows the cost of GPU resources, their percentage contribution to the total cost, and the cost-trend graph for the selected period of time         |
| **Network Cost** | Shows the cost of network usage, its percentage contribution to the total cost, and the cost-trend graph for the selected period of time           | -->

<!-- :::success Tip 
Network cost refers to the expenses associated with **data transfer**, including communication between **pods, nodes, and external services** within or across clusters. Refer to [AWS guide on network cost](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-cluster-networking-costs/) to learn more.

## Potential Savings
 
The **Potential Savings** section estimates how much cost can be saved by comparing the resources you have provisioned with the resources you have actually used. It also shows the percentage of current spend that could be saved.

<SupademoEmbed id="cmg7qkb510x8w2nomc6d29rir" /><br />


| Field                  | Description                                                                                      |
|:---------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Recommended Cost**   | The estimated cost calculated from actual resource usage instead of allocated capacity           |
| **Potential Savings**  | The amount which you could have saved, for the selected time period|
| **Estimated cost reduction**  | The percentage of your current spend that could be saved, for the selected time period           |

## Track Performance

The **Track Performance** section helps you understand costs in more detail by breaking them down across different views and time ranges. It includes two charts, **Cost Breakdown** and **Cost Trend**.

### Cost Trend Line Chart

The **Cost Trend** line chart helps you understand, how your total and individual resource usage costs change over time. It helps you analyze spending patterns and identify which resources contribute most to your overall cost.

<SupademoEmbed id="cmh343wdi09qkcdwp0vw8ncaw" /><br />


Each colored line represents a specific infrastructure component, CPU, Memory, Storage, or GPU, while the Total line combines all costs. Hovering over any point on the graph displays the exact cost breakdown for that day.

You can change the time range (for example, Last 24 hours, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, or Last 90 Days) to view trends for a specific period.

:::info Color Schema 
You can check the color codes for each cost type directly below the chart in the Devtron UI.  
Each color label (like CPU Cost, Memory Cost, or GPU Cost) helps you quickly identify which color represents which resource.
:::

### Cost Breakdown Bar Chart

The **Cost Breakdown** Bar Chart helps you see how costs are distributed across different infrastructure components for the selected time period. 

<SupademoEmbed id="cmgaj0aid3d8l2nomb611rpbl" /><br />


Each bar represents one [Application](../../reference/glossary.md#devtron-apps), [Cluster](../../reference/glossary.md#cluster), [Environment](../../reference/glossary.md#environment), or [Project](../global-configurations/projects.md), and the colored segments in the bar show the share of different infrastructure components. This makes it easy to compare categories and see which infrastructure components are contributing most to their total cost.

You can:

 * Change the time range (for example, Last 24 hours, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, or Last 90 Days) to view trends for a specific period.

 * Filter the cost data by Application, Cluster, Environment, or Project to see how costs are distributed across each scope.

 * Sort the cost data by cost (high to low or low to high) or name (A to Z or Z to A) to quickly find the highest spenders or locate specific items.

:::info Color Schema 
You can check the color codes for each cost type directly below the chart in the Devtron UI.  
Each color label (like CPU Cost, Memory Cost, or GPU Cost) helps you quickly identify which color represents which resource.

## Actions and Insights

The **Actions & Insights** section highlights where you can achieve the highest cost savings. It shows the categories with the largest cost saving opportunities, based on the difference between allocated resources and your actual usage.

<SupademoEmbed id="cmgj316cr0x93krn9l7g4uo7a" /><br />


It also shows the cost visibility status, which displays the number of clusters where cost visibility is enabled, failed, in progress, or not enabled. This helps you understand for which clusters cost data is currently being tracked and if you want you can enable/disable cost tracking for the cluster by clicking on **Go to configurations** button. Refer [configurations](./configurations.md) to learn more.

Each category in the **Top saving opportunities** will show

| Field                  | Description |
|:-----------------------|:------------|
| **Name**               | The name of the category (for example, a cluster, application, or environment) with the largest savings opportunities |
| **Potential Savings (%)** | The percentage of your current spend that could be saved, for the selected time range |
| **Estimated Savings**  | The estimated cost you could save in that category, based on the difference between provisioned and used resources, for the selected time range|

Clicking on any item in this list takes you to its detailed Cost Breakdown page. Refer [Cost Breakdown](./cost-breakdown.md) to learn more.
